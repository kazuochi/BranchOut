BranchOut
=========

A simple iPhone­ version of the BranchOut “hot­ or ­not” duel.
The app randomly picks up 10 user's Facebook friends and displays 2 on screen.
Now, users choose which of their friend is more fun. After 10 round, the app will display the ranking board. 

Shake gesture will sign you out from Facebook, and swipe gesture will skip the round.
